      <p>Someone once asked me, what did I want my college legacy to be...</p>
      <title>My Legacy at UCI</title>
      <p><i>Zot, zot, zot!</i> Fingers curled up in position, bobbing my hand, I join in the thunderous
cheer booming throughout the auditorium. Cheeks throbbing from excessive smiling, intense
emotions flood my mind: excitement, pride, passion. Officially an anteater, my journey through
college begins. It’s time to make my mark.</p>
<p>
UC Irvine, my new home, constitutes a factory through which I will construct myself
over the next four years. Entering a shy, coward, I strive to exit a proud, confident young
woman. Riding along the rollercoaster of college, savoring the ups just to ease the pain on the
downs, I progress towards a prized finish line still out of view. At that golden finish line, I
complete my arduous trek, evaluating whether or not I succeeded in college. Personally, my aim
of college involves acquiring the necessary abilities to obtain a lucrative job in my chosen field
while improving my social skills.
</p>
    <p>Computer science has always interested me. Creating something new just by typing weird
symbols, computer programming embodies a construction company contracted to build the
future, one program at a time. Not always straightforward, coding can present colossal
challenges. But, lucky for me, I thrive on challenges. A female, advancement in computer
science may seem difficult or even futile considering that the stereotype calls for males.
However, during my time at UCI, I hope to change this notion, bringing more recognition to
women in STEM fields. Upon graduating UC Irvine, I hope to see the number of female
applicants in STEM majors increase significantly.</p>
    <p>A strong proponent of the value of education, I plan to utilize my knowledge of
computer science to improve education for children. By employing virtual reality to explore
foreign lands or historical events, kids can engage in the learning. Riding a dinosaur or flying

through outer space can become virtual realities. By performing research at UCI, I endeavor to
discover these revolutionary possibilities.</p>
    <p>Likewise, as a prospective tutor, I plan to educate not only students but potential future
tutors as well. Experimenting with new ways of teaching old concepts would allow me to find
the method of teaching that works best for each student, personalizing the tutoring session.</p>
    <p>A road trip, college encompasses challenging twists and turns, troublesome stop signs
and traffic, and rejuvenating freeways and gas stations. One can’t always prepare for the road
ahead; sometimes the map is outdated or an unexpected crash occurs. However, one can learn
from his/her mistakes to prepare future generations. UC Irvine provides a place for me to leave a
legacy of pride, confidence, diligence, and dedication. A passion for learning, an acceptance of
others, and a desire to change the world signify just a few of the ways I hope to inspire future
anteaters. One day, they too will curl their fingers, cheeks throbbing, bob their hands, and join in
the thunderous cheer booming throughout the auditorium, feeling excitement, pride, and passion.</p>
