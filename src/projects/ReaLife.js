export const longText = "I grew up playing the Game of Life, but now that I'm older and becoming an adult, I realize how unrealistic much of that game is so I decided to make a more realistic verison of it called Real Life. While the set-up is simplistic (just a bunch of buttons in a Google Sheet with JS running in the background), it encompasses much of the different paths, decisions, hardships, and opportunities of real life. The game spans ages 18 to 65. People can choose to go to college (and incur a lot of debt, of course) or go to the military, buy a house and car, have kids, travel, invest, and much more. You earn (and lose) points for the decisions you make as well as random things life throws at you. The goal of the game is to have the most points at the end. The great thing is that there are so many ways the game could turn out, my family can play it again and again and each game will be unique.";
