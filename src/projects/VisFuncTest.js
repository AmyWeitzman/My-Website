export const longText = "As part of my research at UC Irvine in the Department of Ophthalmology, I developed a more comfortable and objective visual function test. Getting one’s eyes examined at the optometrist’s office can often be inconvenient because of people’s busy schedules. Time is lost to travel to the doctor, waiting rooms, follow-up appointments and quantifying visual performance at each visit. Additionally, the process of eye examinations can be uncomfortable. Cumbersome tests, obtrusive equipment, and test discrepancy arising from differences in clinical technicians make visual function testing significantly variable and subjective.  Overall, the current eye examination process is too inefficient and subjective. This project’s goal was to create a more convenient and objective way to measure vision in the clinic, and even in the comfort of home without interacting with another human. We used us an eye tracking device and computerized simulations to objectively measure one’s contrast sensitivity and visual acuity by monitoring one’s responses to stimuli prompts through the movement of their pupils. The eye-tracking device tracks the location of the user’s gaze on the screen and determines whether they have correctly identified the stimulus. Using adaptive algorithms, the simulation progressively varies in difficulty according to the accuracy of the user’s previous responses.";
