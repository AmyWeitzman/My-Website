export const longText = "Being stuck at home in quarantine, playing games, and not being as active outdoors as my family would usually be, I decided to make a real-life Scattergories game that my family could play to have fun and stay in shape. Using our phones, we text a phone number to join the game and then receive a text message with a list of categories and a letter. Everyone then runs around the house, searching for objects that fit the category and start with the letter. When we find objects, we take a picture and send it the House Hunt phone number. The data is stored and when the game is over, it is fed to a website where we can see everyone's results and give out points.";
